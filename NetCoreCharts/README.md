# .NetCoreCharts
 Integrate chart.js with Asp.Net Core application with 4 different types of charts, which are: 

    Pie
    Bar
    Line
    Stacked Bar 

Creation and usage of the Pie, Bar and Line Charts are very similar but the stacked chart is a bit more complex. Basically, a chart is a key-value list grouped in an animated way making it easier to understand and see the numbers, except for the stacked chart which has two keys and a value. A more detailed explanation will be placed with each example.
