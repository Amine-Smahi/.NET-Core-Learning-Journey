## What is Logging
Logging is a very critical and essential part of any software. It helps us in the investigation of the essence of problems. ASP.NET Core has built-in support for logging API's, which is able to work with various logging providers. Using these built-in providers, we can send application logs to one or more destinations and also, we can plug in third party logging frameworks such as Serilog, Nlog, etc.

## What is Serilog
Serilog is a good logging framework and it is built with the structured log data in mind. It is a kind of serializer. Serilog determines the right representation when the properties are specified in log events. To use Serilog logging feature with ASP.NET core 2.1, we need to add the dependency of "Serilog.AspNetCore". Serilog provides variety of sinks such as file, MSSQL, Log4net, PostgreSQL, etc.
